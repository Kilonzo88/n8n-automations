# ⚡ n8n Automations

A simple, growing collection of **n8n workflow exports**.

This repo is intentionally lightweight. It’s mainly for me — but structured clearly enough that anyone curious can follow along.

---

## 📁 Repo structure

Automations are grouped by folder. Each folder represents a **theme or domain**.

```
/
├── email-automation/
│   ├── *.json
│   └── README.md
└── crypto-ai-news-automation/
    ├── *.json
    └── README.md

    (more folders coming)
```

* Each `.json` file = one n8n workflow export
* No nested folders (for now)
* Folder count will grow over time



## ▶️ How to use

1. Open n8n
2. Import the JSON workflow
3. Configure credentials
4. Activate

Nothing fancy.

## 🧠 Notes

* Secrets are **never** stored in this repo
* This README is an index, not documentation
* New folders = new automation domains

*Last updated whenever I add something worth keeping.*
